TeDiGe a.k.a. Tetris Diagram Generator
("te dis-je", lame french pun)

Tedige is a javascript application that let draw, browse and animate Tetris diagram.
It is quite similar to Fumen (http://fumen.zui.jp/) and Tage (http://tage.emaame.com/),
only it has an english interface, documentation and source code and is generally 
awesomer than its japanese counterpart :D .
